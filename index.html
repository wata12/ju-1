            There is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain
             In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an 
             altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable.
            <stan class="text1i">

            Whether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. John Whittow's 
            Dictionary of Physical Geography[5] states "Some authorities regard eminences above
             600 metres (1,969 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."</stan>
            
            In the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, a mountain
             is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (610 m) high,[6] which accords with the 
             official UK government's definition that a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 
             2,000 feet (610 m) or higher.[7] In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence 
             requirement, such as that the mountain rises 300 metres (984 ft) above the surrounding terrain.[1] At one t
             
             ime the US Board on Geographic Names defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (305 m) or taller,[8] but has abandoned
              the definition since the 1970s. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, 
              the US Geological Survey concludes 
            that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.[9]

            Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.
             In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, 
             which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.<stan class="text1i"> Most breeds </stan>were derived from small 
            numbers of founders within the last 200 years, and since then dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change
             and were formed into today's modern breeds due to artificial selection imposed by humans. The skull, body, 
             and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be 
             found within the entire order of carnivores. <stan class="text1i">These breeds possess distinct traits related to morphology,
              which include body size, skull shape, tail phenotype, fur type and colour.[8] Their behavioural traits include guarding, 
              herding, and hunting,[8] retrieving, and scent detection.</stan> Their personality traits include hypersocial behavior, boldness, 
              and aggression,[10] which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs.[8] As a result, present day dogs are 
              the most abundant carnivore species and are dispersed around the world. The most striking example of this dispersal is that 
              of the numerous modern breeds of European lineage during the Victorian era.

        <h2>Saltwater</h2>
        <img class="dog2" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/44GalSaltTank.JPG/250px-44GalSaltTank.JPG" alt="sea fish">
        <p>Saltwater aquariums are a multi-million dollar industry in the United States.
             About 10 million marine fish are imported into the United States each year for aquarium use. 
             The United States imports more saltwater fish than any other country in the world.
              There are approximately 2,000 different species of saltwater fish that are imported and used in captivity.
              [3] In many circumstances, fish used for marine trade are collected using harmful tactics such as cyanide. 
              One way that people are trying to protect the coral reefs is by breeding marine fish in captivity.
               Captive-bred fish are known to be healthier and likely to live longer. Captive-bred fish are less susceptible
                to disease because they have not been exposed to the wild and they have not been damaged during the shipment process.
                 Fish that are bred in captivity are already accustomed to aquarium habitats and food.</p><br>
                 <h3>Habitats</h3>
                 <p>
                   <stan class="text1i"> There are many different components that make up a marine life habitat. Some of them are the temperature of
                     the water, the quality, and quantity of water (flow and depth). Other components that can also contribute to the 
                     habitat of saltwater fish are pH level, salt level,</stan> and alkalinity level. Levels of nitrates and phosphates are 
                     also relevant, particularly when considering conditions for fish in captivity. There are other physical features 
                     that contribute to a habitat which are physical materials like rocks, <div><img class="dog3" src="https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/qeet0P4Yk8mce-Yx-u7q1yO0s6Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():strip_icc()/4551529183_53c033619f_o-588ebc803df78caebc808d25.jpg">
                    </div><p>reefs, and sand or the vegetation like the 
                     amount of algae, water plants, and saltmarsh. Specific fish live in specific habitats based on what they eat or 
                     what cycle of life they are currently at, another thing is the amount of salt that is in the water at that specific 
                     location. Some ocean habitats are not technically in the ocean and these are called estuaries, areas when oceans
                      and rivers meet creating a mixture of salt water and freshwater making a different habitat for different types of fish
                       and creatures to live in. The ocean is home to organisms as large as whales and as small as microscopic marine 
                       organisms such as phytoplankton. However, the vast majority of ocean life that humans are exposed to is simple saltwater fish. 
                       Saltwater fish can live in the deepest
                     depths of the ocean where no sunlight can penetrate, but they can also live on the surface of the water.</p><br>
